Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size

And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly

Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes

"Bob Dylan","Ballad Of Donald White","My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""""Oh, please put me away,""""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
Outside standing, lonely boy-child  
Cold and shivering in the night  
  
On the street, every window  
Save but one, was gleaming bright  
And to this window walked the boy-child  
Peeking in saw, candle light  
  
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys  
Ducks and geese, cherry pies  
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady  
Table bare and tears in her eyes  
  
Into his coat reached the boy-child  
Knowing well there was little there  
He took from his pocket,  
His own Christmas dinner  
A bit of cheese, some bread to share  
  
His outstretched hands  
Held the food and they trembled  
As the door, it opened wide  
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner  
Gently said she, Come inside  
  
The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table  
Glasses two and her last drop of wine  
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas  
And especially, yours and mine  
  
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
That in that town, the happiest Christmas  
Was shared by candle light

Three thousand miles away,  
Now he's working Christmas Day

At least it means no beating from her Dad

She hopes that it won't show

But the kids all said the nursing home was best  
Cause he couldn't live alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the common room they've got the biggest tree  
And it's huge and cold and lifeless

Every couple tries to stop  
Rocking around the Christmas tree,  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling.  
  
You will get a sentimental  
Feeling when you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rocking around the Christmas tree,  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way.

Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  
  
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

He liked bicycles and snow  
He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears  
And critters and creatures that crawled  
Why bugs were some of his very best friends  
Spiders and ants and all  
Now that's not to say that he ever looked down  
On a vision of twinkled lights  
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes  
And a thousand other delights  
And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer  
And a jolly old man in a sleigh  
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things  
And a story of Christmas day  
Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright  
He was full of Christmas cheer  
All of each and every day  
And all throughout the year  
To Him it was more than a special time  
Much more than a special day  
It was more than a beautiful story  
It was a special kind of way  
You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring  
And they've never heard of Santa Claus  
They've never heard the story of the Son Of God  
And that made Alfie pause  
Did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth  
Or the brotherhood of man  
Or know how to love, or know how to give  
If they can't, no one can  
You see, life is a very special kind of thing  
Not just for a chosen few  
But for each and every living, breathing thing

Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, """"They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""""  
And I says, """"No ma, they don't"""".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

There's no Christmas without You  
With caroling and mistletoe  
Children playing in the snow  
But in their hearts the world must know  
There's no Christmas without You  
Your gift of love  
Such a sacrifice for me  
Sent from above  
So that we shall forever see  
  
So with our voices lifted high  
And praises that reaches to the sky  
Jesus You're the reason why  
There's no Christmas without You

In that golden coach that turns into a bed,

Look around them golden sidewalks that you're walking on today  
And you'll see that lonely gutter just a careless step away  
And that altar that they're building you don't even understand  
'Cause you're dazzled by the flashing of the daggers in their hands.  
You'll be dancing in the darkness when their music disappears  
And the jangle of your chains will be the only sound you hear  
'Til your broken body's bleeding on an altar made of stone  
And you've sacrificed your soul to please a world that's sick and wrong

I hope these words find you  
I wrote this letter according to my love for you  
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are  
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box  
Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love  
Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder  
If you are reading this I hope that things are well  
And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail

Say hey what's accurate  
Cause Kelly's at Christmas party and  
Everybody's V.I.P. then,  
I know we all have our problems  
And tryin' to make it better  
So I had to put on my music cake  
And write this Love Letter!

"Tom Lehrer","A Christmas Carol","One very familiar type of song is the christmas carol. although it is perhaps
a bit out of season at this time. however, I'm informed by my """"disk jockey""""
friends - of whom I have none,  
In order to get a song popular by christmas time, you have to start plugging
it well in advance. so here goes. it has always seemed to me after all. that
christmas, with it's spirit of giving, o  
Us all a wonderful opportunity each year to reflect on what we all most
sincerely and deeply believe in.  
I refer of course, to money. and yet none of the christmas carols that you
hear on the radio or in the street, even attempt to capture the true spirit of
christmas as we celebrate it in the unit  
Ates. that is to say the commercial spirit. so I should like to offer the
following christmas carol for next year, as being perhaps a bit more
appropriate.  
Christmas time is here, by golly,  
Disapproval would be folly,  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly,  
Fill the cup and don't say """"when.""""  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens,  
Mix the punch, drag out the dickens,  
Even though the prospect sickens,  
Brother, here we go again.  
On christmas day you can't get sore,  
Your fellow man you must adore,  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four.  
Relations, sparing no expense'll  
Send some useless old utensil,  
Or a matching pen and pencil.  
""""just the thing I need! how nice!""""  
It doesn't matter how sincere it  
Is, nor how heartfelt the spirit,  
Sentiment will not endear it,  
What's important is the price.  
Hark the herald tribune sings,  
Advertising wondrous things.  
God rest ye merry, merchants,  
May you make the yuletide pay.  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and buy!  
So let the raucous sleigh bells jingle,  
Hail our dear old friend kris kringle,  
Driving his reindeer across the sky.  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by.  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last christmas. the nicest present I
received was a gift certificate """"good at any hospital for a lobotomy"""". rather
thoughtful.

Faces of friends in the crowd  
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders  
Driven away by the sound  
  
Now the heart that for years had been silent  
Was suddenly filled with the new King  
As she clung to their hands like a child in the night  
She found herself this revelling  
  
What sweeter music can we bring,

The birth of this our heavenly King?

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

"Chicago","Love Was New","Remember when we were first falling in love  
How we planned all the things we would do  
Beautiful days and the nights all ablaze  
Hoping our dreams would come true  
Love was new  
Remember the house at the top of the hill  
How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze  
Love was new  
Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you, every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you,falling in love every day with you

"Christmas Songs","A Christmas Carol","One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol.  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time.  
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends - of whom  
I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here  
Goes.  
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas,  
With it's spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in - I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street,  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial  
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.  
  
Christmas time is here, by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and don't say when  
  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother, here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you can't get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four  
  
Relations, sparing no expense, 'll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
(""""Just the thing I need, how nice!"""")  
  
It doesn't matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
What's important is the price  
  
Hark, the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and - buy!  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by

The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
""""Good at any hospital for a lobotomy""""... rather thoughtful.

She said, I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep  
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside  
Hey sleepyhead, it must have snowed at least a foot last night  
That's when I saw it hangin' up above my head  
She threw her arms around my neck  
Laughin' as she said  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
'Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin' on the radio

Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.  
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,  
But as for me and grandpa we believe.  
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,  
And we begged her not to go.  
But she forgot her medication, and she  
Staggered out the door into the snow.  
When we found her Christmas morning,  
At the scene of the attack,  
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,  
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.  
  
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,  
He's been taking this so well.  
See him in there watching football,  
Drinking root beer and  
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.  
It's not Christmas without Grandma,  
All the family's dressed in black  
And we just can't help but wonder:  
Should we open up her gifts,  
Or send them back?  
Send them back!!  
  
Now the goose is on the table  
And the pudding made of fig  
And the blue and silver candles  
That would just have matched  
The hair on grandma's wig.  
I've warned all my  
Friends and neighbors  
Better watch out for yourselves,  
They should never give a license  
To a man who drives a sleigh  
And plays with elves

Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable

Happy """"Ho! Ho! Ho!"""" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' Santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said  
""""Little boys like you should be in bed""""  
  
So I hollered """"Ho! Ho! Ho!""""  
And I put on Santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat

The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof  
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof  
As Santa slid down the chimney wall  
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all  
  
From beyond the moat there arose such a clatter  
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter  
Like a bolt of lightning it happened so quick  
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick  
  
He began to dig down deep in his sack  
And came up with the traction for Igor's back  
Drac got his cape  
Franky's trike made him behave  
Even Wolfman was happy now he can shave

And Santa was really swell  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
No need to rob Santa's sleigh  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Maybe next year he'll come back  
  
So the children everywhere were spared the grief  
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief  
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave  
And never again rob sleighs or graves

The snow was falling Christmas Eve  
I stood behind her in the frozen foods  
And I touched her on the sleeve  
  
She didn't recognize the face at first  
But then her eyes flew open wide  
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse  
And we laughed until we cried  
  
We took her groceries to the check out stand  
The food was totaled up and bagged  
We stood there lost in our embarrassment  
As the conversation lagged  
  
We went to have ourselves a drink or two  
But couldn't find an open bar  
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store  
And we drank it in her car  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how  
  
She said she's married her an architect  
Who kept her warm and safe and dry  
She would have liked to say she loved the man  
But she didn't like to lie  
  
I said the years had been a friend to her  
And that her eyes were still as blue  
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw  
Doubt or gratitude  
  
She said she saw me in the record stores  
And that I must be doing well  
I said the audience was heavenly  
But the traveling was Hell

We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how

Then the first snow came  
And she ran out to brush the snow away

Came running in all excited

And hugged my neck  
I came home unexpectedly

And cries down in the flower bed

Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much

I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'

We still sit at separate tables  
And we sleep at different times  
And the warm wind in the palm trees  
Hasn't helped to change our minds  
  
It was the lure of the tropics  
That I thought might heal the scars  
Of a love burned out by silence  
In a marriage minus heart  
  
And I call the kids on the telephone  
Say there's something wrong out here  
It's july but it's cold as christmas  
In the middle of the year  
  
The temperature's up to ninety five  
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes  
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here  
So how come it's cold as christmas in the middle of the year  
  
I dreamed of love in a better climate  
And for what it's really worth  
I put faith in the star we followed  
To this caribbean surf  
  
But there's an icy fringe on everything  
And I cannot find the lines  
Where's the beauty in the beast we made

Pulling on the reins.

He loves you just the same.  
Santa knows that we're God's children,  
That makes everything right.  
Fill your hears with Christmas cheer,

"Garth Brooks","The Gift","A poor orphan girl named Maria  
Was walking to market one day  
She stopped for a rest by the roadside  
Where a bird with a broken wing lay  
A few moments passed till she saw it  
For it's feathers were covered with sand  
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling  
In the warmth of Maria's small hand  
  
She happily gave her last peso  
On a cage made of rushes and twine  
She fed it loose corn from the market  
And watched it grow stronger with time  
  
Now the Christmas Eve service was coming  
And the church shone with tinsel and light  
And all of the townfolk brought presents  
To lay by the manger that night  
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes  
In packages fit for a king  
But for one ragged bird in a small cage  
Maria had nothing to bring  
  
She waited till just before midnight  
So no one could see her go in  
And crying she knelt by the manger  
For her gift was unworthy of Him  
  
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness  
Maria, what brings you to me  
If the bird in the cage is your offering  
Open the door, let me see  
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her  
And out of the cage the bird flew  
Soaring into the rafters  
On a wing that had healed good as new  
  
Just then the midnight bells rang out  
And the little bird started to sing  
A song that no words could recapture  
Whose beauty was fit for a king  
  
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen  
To that cascade of notes sweet and long  
As her offering was lifted to heaven  
By the very first nightingale's song

All the streets are filled with laughter and light  
And the music of the season  
And the merchants' windows are all bright  
With the faces of the children  
And the families hurrying to their homes  
As the sky darkens and freezes  
Will be gathering around their hearths and tables  
Giving thanks for all god's graces  
And the birth of the rebel Jesus  
  
Well they call him by the prince of peace  
And they call him by the savior  
And they pray to him upon the seas  
And in every bold endeavor  
As they fill his churches with their pride and gold  
And their faith in him increases  
But they've turned the nature that I worship in  
From a temple to a robber's den  
In the words of the rebel Jesus  
  
We guard our world with locks and guns  
And we guard our fine possessions  
And once a year when Christmas comes  
We give to our relations  
And perhaps we give a little to the poor  
If the generosity should seize us  
But if any one of us should interfere  
In the business of why they are poor  
They get the same as the rebel jesus  
  
But please forgive me if I seem  
To take the tone of judgement  
For I've no wish to come between  
This day and your enjoyment  
In this life of hardship and of earthly toil  
We have need for anything that frees us  
So I bid you pleasure  
And I bid you cheer  
From a heathen and a pagan  
On the side of the rebel jesus.

tried to put into one song, everything that had ever been in any of the
country and western songs we had ever heard. Tried to put it all into one
song. Serves us right. This is what came out:  
  
Well it was all I could do to keep from cryin'  
Some times it seems so useless to remain  
You're the one who always tried to change me  
And that is why I will always stay the same  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name  
  
No, you don't have to call me Freddy Fender  
You don't have to call me Charlie Pride  
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though you know you're on my fighting side  
  
Chorus- this verse only:  
And I'm gonna hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain (when nights are cold and lonely)  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by name.

[spoken] And there's only one thing I'm really sure of was that sucker  
You're gonna hear it when my savior calls me home  
  
[spoken] That's a lot to get into one song. We left out all the good stuff.
Dallas, dope, divorce, dead dogs, trains prison Christmas, mothers, farms, and
trucks. Mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms, Christmas, and dead dogs are
essential, you can't have a good country song without them things. And with
all due respect this song needs mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms,
Christmas and dead dogs and is that it? Whatever it is - it's also 4 minutes
long already (they're going 'when's he gonna end, when's he gonna end in the
booth back there') So I'll just tack this verse on the end here-

Running as fast as I could run  
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas  
Whispering, """"You're the only one""""  
  
And ever since I was a boy  
I never felt that I belonged  
Like everything they did to me  
Was an experiment to see  
How I would cope with the illusion  
In which direction would I jump  
Would I do it all the same  
As the actors in the game  
Or would I spit it back at them  
And not get caught up in their rules  
And live according to my own  
And not be used, not be used  
To find the fundamental truths  
It was going to take some time  
Thirty five summers down the line  
The wisdom of each passing year  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
  
Daddy came out the navy and took us away  
To his dirty grey home town  
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service  
So that he could be around  
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust  
Of his Triumph motor bike  
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner  
Holding tight  
  
From the horizon  
Came home from the Navy to the mine  
From the horizon  
To buried alive  
Took his dream underground  
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes  
  
And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine  
Of a half remembered afternoon  
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain  
Found the boy, decided that his time had come  
Came down out of the sky  
Stung him in the face  
Again and again  
Blue pain  
Screaming like baptism  
Intravenous, Jesus!  
Like being chosen  
Blue pain from something with no brain  
I can't explain  
It's happening again  
It's happening again  
  
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you sit a while with me  
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory  
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay  
Table mountain, flying fish, banana spiders, pots of paint  
And the sun on the equator  
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water  
From crimson to black  
But coming back  
Tomorrow  
On the horizon  
  
The blue pain  
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade  
It stayed  
Blue  
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine  
This love  
  
This love  
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond  
This puzzle  
I don't understand  
That knows no faith  
And tries and fails  
And tries again  
Stares at the sea  
The night's dark deep  
For one last time  
And bleeds  
And bleeds  
And dies for you  
And lies  
And is to blame  
And is ashamed  
And is not the same  
And is true  
And is true

This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song

[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say """"My true love ain't here""""  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man

But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch

Came a light bright as a star  
Cutting through the night  
Was the two headlights

Perry the platypus  
Had a mission at the Pole  
If he could lend a hand in the frozen land  
He'd help Santa reach his goal

For when Santa saw the gas gauge  
He knew it could take him far

Perry the platypus

Look toward the shore for my signal  
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay  
  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again  
He's crazy, anyway  
  
If a yellow flag is fluttering  
Sickly herald against the morn  
Then you'll know my courage has ended  
And you'll send your boat ashore

As he blows with his eyes froze tight  
Slidell boy, big city nights

An old stray beggin' for a bite

Play something happy, leave the sad one's alone  
Crackin' a smile as small as wishes  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
  
Hey, puttin' out the dog, put the wheels on tight

By the ghost of Christmas past  
Face the future Undaunted  
Step aside or take your chance

Won or lost before begun  
While we thrive on mass confusion  
Thus we walk before we run

Here on earth and out in space  
Forward on the road to glory  
History records the chase  
  
Have yourselves that certain Christmas  
Eat be glad and drink the wine  
Leave your sadness by the river  
Giving love and given time

Along the lanes a lover takes  
Run with the fox  
Beneath the moon a Christmas moon  
Run with the fox

A criminals wears a curse  
I want to chase that rabbit right off the rails  
And rip this metal keeping my mouth in check  
But I need that muzzle like a razor and a stubble  
Cuttin all this history from my neck  
Do you remember the gear I first saw you in  
Eating Mexican in '92?  
In between your folks and a birthday toast  
It was black from your fringe to your shoes  
I'm picking apples out of paintings  
And making record covers in the sky  
I missed my boat sitting here imagining  
Your face when you cry  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
  
This whole day threw up some tickets  
None I'd ever choose  
The sky's so heavy it hangs like a beer gut  
Spilling stuff on my shoes  
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining  
I still got my legs like an old Christmas tree  
But if I got faith why am I so scared  
Everybody's dying on me

Fish and chips stall down the south coast ready  
I can show you what I'm worth  
So set me up a bottle and salt and vinegar
